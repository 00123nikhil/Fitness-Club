      <h2>What is Health</h2>
      <h5><span class="label label-danger"></span> <span class="label label-primary"></span></h5><br>
      <p>“Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”. Physical fitness is not the sole basis of being healthy; being healthy means being mentally and emotionally fit. Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle. Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. Feeling good about yourself and taking care of your health are important for your self-esteem and self-image. Maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body. .</p>

      <h2>Importance of Health</h2>
      <h5><span class="label label-success"></span></h5><br>
      <p>A healthy person is a person who is able to serve himself, his nation and his community. 
     An unhealthy person who suffers from illness sees him weak and meager, unable to properly carry out the duties and responsibilities incumbent on him. 
     When the disease develops, the person becomes dependent on other people and cannot meet his different needs in life, which affects his psyche as well due to his sense of helplessness and weakness. 
    Society is also affected by the presence of the disease among its members, as the productivity of these patients weakens and they become dependent on society. 
    As for the presence of healthy individuals in society, this means the presence of productive individuals who possess the power and the ability to give and serve.</p>
    <p>Psychologically healthy people feel comfortable and happy in their lives and enjoy life well. 
    A person who suffers from mental illnesses always sees him as a gloomy and pessimist and does not feel happy in his life and in his relationships with people. 
    While you see a healthy person enjoying happiness in his life, establishing his relationships with people and showing love, kindness, and intimacy.</p>
